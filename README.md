# 📰 Fake News Detection AI

An intelligent **Machine Learning + NLP** project that detects whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real** using advanced text analysis.  
Built as part of the **ByteBrilliance AI** initiative to combat misinformation with data-driven truth detection.

---

## 📌 Overview
The **Fake News Detection AI** classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **ML algorithms**.  
It processes and learns from real-world news data, enabling accurate detection of misinformation.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧹 Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- ✍️ TF-IDF vectorization for text representation
- 🤖 Trained ML model (Logistic Regression / PassiveAggressiveClassifier)
- 🧪 Real-time prediction through **Hugging Face demo**
- 🔁 Retrainable with custom datasets

---

## 🗂 Dataset
Trained on a large **Fake News Dataset** containing thousands of verified and falsified news articles.  
Balanced dataset ensures the model learns accurate linguistic cues and semantic patterns.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Python** | Programming Language |
| **Pandas, NumPy** | Data Processing |
| **Scikit-learn** | Model Training & Evaluation |
| **NLTK** | Text Cleaning |
| **Hugging Face + Gradio** | Live Demo Deployment |

## 🧾 Demo Examples

**🟥 Fake News Example:**
> *Pakistan to Replace All School Teachers With AI Robots by 2026*  
> In an unprecedented move, the Government of Pakistan has announced that by early 2026, all school teachers will be replaced with fully autonomous AI-powered robots.  
> *(Predicted: FAKE ✅)*

**🟩 Real News Example:**
> *Pakistan Launches New STEM Scholarship Program for Matric Students*  
> The Ministry of Science and Technology has introduced a new STEM scholarship program aimed at high-performing matric students across Pakistan.  
> *(Predicted: REAL ✅)*

*(Runs directly in your browser — enter a news headline or paragraph and get instant results!)*

---

## 📈 Results
| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | ~97% |
| **Precision (Fake)** | 0.96 |
| **Recall (Fake)** | 0.95 |
| **Algorithm** | Logistic Regression / PassiveAggressiveClassifier |

The model achieves strong generalization across unseen text, making it reliable for real-world fake news detection.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- 🚀 Integrate **BERT / Transformer-based architectures**
- 🌍 Support **multi-language news detection**
- 🔌 Build a **browser plugin / Chrome extension**
- 📱 Launch a **mobile-friendly version** via Gradio
