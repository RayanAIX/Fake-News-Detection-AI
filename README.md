# 📰 Fake News Detection AI

## 📌 Overview
The **Fake News Detection AI** is a Machine Learning project that classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Real**.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **ML algorithms** to detect misinformation effectively.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of news text (cleaning, tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization).  
- Trained ML model for binary classification (Fake / Real).  
- Interactive **Hugging Face demo** for real-time news validation.  
- Easy to retrain with custom datasets.  

---

## 🗂 Dataset
The model was trained on the **Fake News Dataset** containing thousands of real and fake news articles.  
It ensures balanced training for robust classification.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)  
- Hugging Face Spaces + Gradio (for live demo)

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** on test data.  
- Detects fake news with strong precision and recall.  
- Provides reliable predictions on unseen news articles.  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add **deep learning models** (BERT / Transformer-based).  
- Support for **multi-language news detection**.  
- Deploy as a **browser plugin** for real-time verification.
